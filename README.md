# One Finger Death Punch Auto Player (2016)

One Finger Death Punch is a reaction game in which you perform counterattacks by pressing only two buttons.
The opponent must be in range to do this.

This modification bypasses the need to press buttons, allowing the player to autonomously go on the attack as soon as an opponent is in range.
