# OFDP Auto Player (2016)

One Finger Death Punch (OFDP) is a reaction game in which you perform counterattacks by pressing two buttons only.
The opponent must be in range to counterattack successfully.

This modification bypasses the need to press buttons, allowing the player to autonomously go on the attack as soon as an opponent is in range.
